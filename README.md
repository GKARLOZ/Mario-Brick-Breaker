# Mario-Brick-Breaker
Mario rides Yoshi to break all the bricks. Mario can't touch the bottom surface unless it is the paddle. 
The player needs to move the paddle with the right or left direction to avoid Mario from falling.

This is the second project I created with Java; so, it might have minor errors.

Download the zip file from the "clone or download" button.

Open the zip file 

Open the "Main.java" file with your IDE and compile it. You should be able to play it now!!

Since my code has a package called "MarioBrickBreaker" everything needs to stay in the same folder "MarioBrickBreaker" to avoid any issues.

Have fun!!
